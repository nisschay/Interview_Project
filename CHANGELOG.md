# Interview Platform - Recent Changes

## Major Updates (Latest)

### ðŸŽ¯ Question Generation & Evaluation System Overhaul

#### 1. **Randomized Question Generation**
- âœ… **Fixed**: Questions are now truly randomized using enhanced AI prompts
- âœ… **Improvement**: Each question generation includes:
  - Topics already covered (to avoid repetition)
  - Question number tracking
  - Role and level-specific requirements
  - Explicit instructions to generate UNIQUE questions
- âœ… **Prompt Enhancement**: Added "AVOID these already covered topics" section to prevent duplicates

#### 2. **Evaluation System - End of Interview Only**
- âœ… **Removed**: Real-time per-question evaluation
- âœ… **New**: All answers are evaluated together at the end of the interview
- âœ… **Better UX**: Users can answer questions without waiting for evaluation
- âœ… **Answers Saved**: Each answer is stored immediately upon submission

#### 3. **New Scoring System**
- âœ… **Points-Based Scoring**:
  - Easy questions: **1 point** (max)
  - Medium questions: **3 points** (max)
  - Hard questions: **5 points** (max)
  - Total possible: **26 points** (4Ã—1 + 4Ã—3 + 2Ã—5)
  
- âœ… **Quality-Based Grading**:
  - 90-100% correct answer â†’ **Full marks**
  - 60-89% correct answer â†’ **Half marks**
  - 30-59% partially correct â†’ **Quarter marks**
  - 0-29% poor/wrong â†’ **Zero marks**
  
- âœ… **Strict Evaluation**:
  - Gibberish or irrelevant answers â†’ **0-5 score** (AI evaluates strictly)
  - AI uses JSON-based evaluation for consistency
  - Final score converted to percentage (0-100%)

#### 4. **UI/UX Improvements**
- âœ… **Sidebar Restructure**:
  - Timer at top
